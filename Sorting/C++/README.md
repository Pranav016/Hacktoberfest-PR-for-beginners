# Sorting Algos in _C++_
- Give proper file names. (_PascalCasing_ is required)
    - ```
      XyzSort.cpp
      ```

- Functional programming is must.
    - ```
      int main() { ... func(); }
      void func() { ... }
      ```

- Proper commenting is recommended.
    - ```
      // a function to specify the swapping of variables
      
      or

      /* a function to specify the swapping of variables */
      ```
